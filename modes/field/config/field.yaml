# field mode tracks the following variables which are used to start a MB at whcih time field ends to resume when MB finished.
# Field tracks Poseidon-hits, olympus-hits, drop-hits (mystery), hydra-hits, spinner-hits (super spinner). During ball locking it stops counting
# drop hits and mystery excludes subway locking.
# field stops for subway locking and during all multiballs.
# field_p_orbit_loops: counter every 2 orbit loops from either direction activates magnet in hardware to drop ball in p area
#    enabled by sis on left disabled by sis on right or not counting when field not running.
# field_o_orbit_loops: counter every 3 orbit loops from either direction activates magnet in hardware to drop ball in 0 area
#    enabled by sis on left disabled by sis on right or not counting when field not running.
# field_hydra: counter when hydra hits = 10 ball_block rises and a hit to BB target starts battle hydra mode stopping field
# field_spinner: counter when spinners total 100 post diverter is enabled and CCW orbit hit send ball to hidden hole for mystery award
# field_subways: counter trips through subway. After 10, BB drops and hit to scoop causes subway locking mode to activate
# Other potential field driven modes: ramp challenge, switch back and forth with doubling of score each time.
# Another potential: orbit challenge. Repeat orbit shots results in a score prize and light show.
