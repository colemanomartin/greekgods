#battle hydra mode
#Enter mode from mystery or after hitting field's scoop shot after hydra prox sensor hit 29 x during while no balls locked.
#Start with one ball, with every ball hit an extra ball is served up to 6 balls. Hit hydra 15 more times
#and hydra is defeated. When back down to one ball mode terminates.
#10-17-22 previously, mode would not enter with either prmb or ormb running.  Now both have  stopping events
#when thismode starts.  Field also stops when this mode starts (after scoop shot hit).
#Field restarts when this mode ends and if appropriate {device.accruals.base_o/p_locking_engaged.completed}
#the apporpriate locking mode also restarts. IF hydra shot invited by scoop and player subsiquently
#locks a ball the scoop shot is disabled.  Then hits to hydra jump the score down to pre-threshold level if a ball is locked.
#See field counter field_hydra_hits
#Replicate strategy for goddess qualification.
# If it keeps serving balls when it should not it is probably because there are not six balls in the trough.
