MachineGG2012 Cleaning up logic of widgets and shows in p_ramp_mb and o_ramp_mb
MachineGG2012 More cleaning up logic of widgets and shows in p_ramp_mb and o_ramp_mb
MachineGG2013 last local copy before moving to Github
Oct23: installed orbit_post_left, renamed original to orbit_post_right
MPF Notes
mpf -x runs without attempting to connect to the P-ROC hardware
mpf -X use smart virtual hardware'
mpf -b dont connect to media controller
mpf -t dont show asciimatics screen with switch summary
mpf mc connects to media controller only
mpf both -x runs both without connecting to hardware
mpf both -X -t smart virtual and Text output or errors
mpf game -v -V run mpf with extra verbose logging
autocomplete-plus is a free plug in reccommended by MPF for faster coding.
there is test code for each of the steps in the tutorial.
iMC is interactive MC which allows changing slides and parameters while
  MC is running allowing the changes to be seen in real time.
Install mpf-monitor see chapter 17, or pg 708 in Dev PDF. This stand alone
  program allows a graphical mouse click to trigger switches on the virtual
  play field and is better for debugging.  Will need an image of the playfield.
  It also shows LED's.

  Home: when MPF first starts up, and after a game ends, it will automatically eject any
balls from any devices that are not tagged with “home.” When a player tries to start a game,
MPF will also make sure all the balls in the machine are contained in devices tagged with “home.”
Troughs and sometimes shooter lanes are tagged home.
  Trough:  Tells MPF that a ball device wants to hold as many balls as it can.
This probably doesn’t make sense right now, which is fine, but without this tag then MPF won’t know
what to do with all the balls that are sitting in the trough waiting to be launched. This tag tells MPF
that it’s fine for this device to hold lots of balls.
  Drain: used to tell MPF that a ball entering this device
means that a live ball has drained from the playfield.

Details on positioning text on slides and how dynamic player variables
work can be found on page 125.

I have a part MPF, part Ubuntu question. Being that I am not a big Linux user,
I cannot get my Ubuntu 18.0.4 to start MPF on bootup. I have tried crons, ic.
local files, bash, and the "startup app preferences". What are you guys doing
to start it up? It just boots up to the desktop, and nothing...
jwilson [7:16 PM]
Well, Ubuntu is using systemd so you need to enable rc.local support first,
then you can start it from /etc/rc.local.
sudo systemctl enable rc-local.service
I had some weird performance issues running MPF as a systemd
service so I use supervisord to manage it.  I run supervisord from
rc.local and then start/stop MPF with supervisorctl.


event handling
In a mode with slides "first_ball_intro" and lets_go defigned this would call
those slides with the following values of ball_started
slide_player:
  ball_started{ball==1}: first_ball_intro
  ball_started{ball>1}: lets_go
  ball_started{ball==1 or ball==3}: special_slide   # != is not equal
  ball_started{current_player.score > 1000000}: you_rule
ball_started{current_player.score < 10000 and ball == 3}: you_stink


you can set up 2 devices that use the same coil  (example regular flipper and
NO-HOLD flipper) and disable/enable them when needed but, I haven't seen a
config where you have 2 different rules (different pulse times, or different
control switches) that would require the rule to be re-written to the hardware
mid-game (edited)
jwilson [9:51 AM]
Pulse times are set in the coil definition, not the device one unfortunately.
jab [10:23 AM]
@Coleman you can also set two pulse times in MPF
most common thing is flippers like @markinc mentioned
@jwilson you can overwrite the pulse time in most devices

Maybe this is how I enable????

Setting delays:
In event_player, Specify a delay by using a pipe. For example:
event_player:
  triggering_event:
     event_to_be_triggered|250ms

That will delay the event by the time specified.

Can also set delays by priority which has different syntax: the priority of an incoming handler is specified with a period after the event name. Higher priority events will be handled first, so you can avoid race conditions and have a guaranteed order of operations.

event_player:
  mode_something_started.100:
    - event_thats_posted_first
  mode_something_started.50:
    - event_thats_posted_second

Priorities on outgoing events are done with an argument in the event body. This is applicable not just to event player, but sound player, show player, and any other player.

event_player:
  mode_something_started:
    event_thats_posted_one:
      priority: 20
    event_thats_posted_two:
      priority: 10

Making a bar graph out of LEDs such as multiplier number on the speakers.
      light_player:
        "{machine.test_machine_var == 23}":
          led4: red
        "{current_player.test_player_var == 42}":
          led5: red
      This example is tested to be valid MPF config. However, it is not integration tested. Some parts are hidden. Click to show full config.
      If will turn led4 to red once the machine variable test_machine_var becomes 23 and turns led4 back to off once test_machine_var becomes something else. Same for led5 and player variable test_player_var.



Wireshark
  packet sniffer.
  When installing select Y to grant group access to sniffing.
  Add myself to the group after installing by sudo adduser $USER wireshark
  To capture under ubuntu issue the following commands at the beginning of the session:
    sudo modprobe usbmon
    sudo setfacl -m u:$USER:r /dev/usbmon*
  Then fire up wireshark.

How  to install a branch from github:
  go to the branch and down load the folder. unzip the folder and enter it with terminal. issue the command "sudo pip3 install -e ."  Dont forget the "." it designates the directory.

MPF Test environment:

GitHub notes:
1. create repo on github. Its tied to junkmail address. GH username is colemanomartin password G with numbers x2
2. go to a target directory for the local repo and at command line enter git clone https://github.com/colemanomartin/greekgods
3. When adding to the local repo
    git add .
    git commit -m "notes on this commit are required"
    git push and enter colemanomartin and github pw

    git add -A stages all changes
    git add . stages new files and modifications, without deletions
    git add -u stages modifications and deletions, without new files
4. To get the latest from the repo go to the target directory
    git pull

To get to the repo from ssh have to generate a local ssh public and private key this is described on right side upper right of github under settings
    https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
    https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
    It allows a secure connection from this computer without entering username and password each time.
    On Ubuntu
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "colemanomartin@hotmail.com"
    Enter for default file in which to save key
    Enter a passphrase (this will be used when setting up link in atom)
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"    Will have to enter password
    sudo apt-get install xclip   Install this and myabe a package too.
    xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub   This copies the key to the clipboard so the key can be pasted into the account, Title the key for the name of the compter
    ssh -T git@github.com  should verify that a SSH connection exists

    git remote -v  shows the web location of the account pre...
       origin	https://github.com/colemanomartin/greekgods (fetch)
       origin	https://github.com/colemanomartin/greekgods (push)
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:colemanomartin/greekgods.git     moves it over to a ssh location
       origin	git@github.com:colemanomartin/greekgods.git (fetch)
       origin	git@github.com:colemanomartin/greekgods.git (push)
    git pull   the next time will complane that the authenticity of the host cannot be established.  Its OK to add it permanently to the list of known hosts.

Troubleshooting: One time it would not push because I added a directory to logs. Another time because I tried to include a log that was > 100mb


6. Setting up Atom.  File-> Add project file   select the location of the local repo.
   Packages -> toggle Github tab.
   Edit a file and save.
   Stage all
   Add a commit message.
   Commit to master
   Push
   To pull, click Fetch and then Pull.

Things to add:

  Combo shot for double orbit with light show and point bonus.
  Combo shot for hit BB then scoop. Ball hold and contracting circle of light.
  4 hits to scoop triggers scoop mb. Prevent if in subway locking.
  Sweeps to attract
consider: make diverter pop up on godess lock after underworld opened, similar to scoop. Could make it alternate or random calling shot with arrows.
  Consider scoop and hydra activating when one ball locked and p ramp and o ramp not qualidied, would have to take over diverter.
  Scoop needs dressing up with a light theme and a playfield slide.
  Right down the middle ball save.
  Eject time outs for ramps
  Minimum balls

May be able to combine diverters for mystery and scoop using mystery's hole hit to deactivate.

  adjust probabilities on mystery depending on locking

  Dont raise BB after starting super spinner. #Not sure why I said this.

Make hades mini game a mystery option when balls are locked somewhere.

bonus mode with exit.
When extra ball is awarded, put EB on screen so player understands why ball number did not change at next ball. Remove EB on next ball unless there are more than one.

Add skill shot to upper 3 lanes and shot rotation.  Create a shot group for the 3 tied to events in the P and O area.
convert orbit sweeps to color stop so they work with MB collors
make green mb insert palate versus green rotation for goddess BB green too.
I might be able to recover from a missing ball with this event triggering mb https://docs.missionpinball.org/en/latest/events/balldevice_ball_device_ball_missing.html

consider moving sweep_server to non-game mode that runs when attract runs

Turn scoop MB into return souls to the underworld.


Jackpot for P_MB: gate
Jackpot for O mb: pop-hole
Jackpot for Scoop MB: scoop (Keep BB down)
Jackpot for double MB either gate or hole

Things to fix:

sometimes on multiple games light show at left drops does not reset with game start.
Sometimes call the shot show does not reset after goddess summoned.

One time when playing hydra lights went out on lower playfield.  No clear reason why.  Saved log in weirdlogs
Rarely display_light_player will cover all the lights at game start.


OK to raise BB for single mode qualification when SS pending but have to drop it again or maybe increase timer on BB.



Hardware:
  Check trough switches.
  adjust spoon olympus pop
  adjust stitch under left powerball.
  fix sling behind drops
  bigger rubber on post by pop.
  post at lower left apron.

Wish list:
  multiple_hits_window in shots
  reset event for state machines that brings it back to start
  ability to repeat last n steps in an animation
  tie light activation sequence to a range on a counter
