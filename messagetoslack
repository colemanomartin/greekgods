  I've been stuck on this for hours.  I'm using v0.55 and can't get my counter's control events to process. In this example the count events will add to the count but the control events wont be processed. The logicblock does not update with control events. My exampleseems to conform to the examples I am seeing.  Anything popping out to other people?
 Counters: 
  base_count_test:
    count_events:
      - s_left_slingshot_active
      - s_right_slingshot_active
    control_events:
      - event: s_poseidon_left_slingshot_active
        action: subtract
        value: 1
      - event: s_poseidon_right_slingshot_active
        action: subtract
        value: 1
    debug: true
